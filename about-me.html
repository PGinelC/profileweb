            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 22 year old Spanish graduate looking to work in the UK and Europe.</p>
             My background is in software engineering, however, I define myself for my enjoyment of learning.<br>
             In my attempt to figure out what to do after university, I have interested myself for many fields inside of computer science and outside of it, 
             including graphic design, finance and consulting. <br>
             However, for better or worse, I have found that what makes me enjoy a field is my capacity to see myself improve and
              make a meaningful impact.</p>
            <p>Wherever I work, I like the people around me to be the highlight of my day.
                I think of honesty a bit as my super power, I am a very genuine person and I believe that has allowed me
                 to make strong connections with people.
            </p>
            <p>My current career goal is to improve my software development and interpersonal skills,
                 as well as exploring what the working world is like.</p>
            <p>I am always happy to have a chat, so feel free to drop me an email!<br>
                Thanks and regards :)

                    <p>I partcipated in a year long student project with Censis. The ask was to make listener chips
                        used for welfare housing security more intelligent using machine learning. We achieved this by
                        sending compressed audio from the chips to a server that would then classify the sound
                        with a neural network. We worked as a team of 6 with a very strong focus on exploring Agile and
                        Scrum.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed an IoT solution for welfare housing safety, coding listener chips in C and
                            processing information through a neural network in a Python-based Django back-end.</li>
                        <li>Coordinated with a team of 6 using Agile and Scrum methods, working in 3-week sprints,
                            delivering presentations and demos at sprint review meetings.</li>
                        <li>Negotiated requirements with stakeholders and proposed several solutions to hardware
                            limitations, recommending an IoT architecture to offload machine learning to the cloud,
                            keeping hardware costs low.</li>
                        <li>Explored 7 machine learning approaches in python for time series classification, developing
                            a model with 97% accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Analyzed an undocumented C codebase of over 100 files, injecting code to successfully
                            uncover bottlenecks and limitations.</li>
                        <li>Served as the primary liaison between the team and the client, responsible for organizing
